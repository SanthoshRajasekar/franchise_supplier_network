FranchiseSuppplierNetwork website assignment

Hi Team,

1. Please run the franchise_suppliers_script.py script
  "python3 franchise_suppliers_script.py"
   which will crawl and save all the webpages as .txt and .jpg files in a folder called "output".

2. After crawling gets completed, please execute the count_finder_script to get the counts of all the scraped .txt files with output folder as an argument to be passed in the command.

     "python3 count_finder_script.py output/"
